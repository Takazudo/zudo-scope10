"""Extension hook for scripts/validate.py.

Later topics add checks here so they never need to touch validate.py's
structural checks or their ordering. Each entry in EXTRA_CHECKS is a callable
`fn(check, ctx)`:
- `check(name, value, detail='')` is the same recorder validate.py's own checks
  use; calling it appends to the shared report and fails the run on a falsy
  value, exactly like a built-in check.
- `ctx` is a dict with the objects validate.py already parsed, so a hook needs
  no re-parsing: `R` (project root Path), `cat` (component records list),
  `byid` (records keyed by id), `circuit` (design/circuit.json contents),
  `parts` (circuit['parts']), `pby` (parts keyed by ref).

Starts empty: no sub-issue has added a check yet.
